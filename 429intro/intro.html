			  <h4>what is this document?</h4>
			  <p>This is intended to be a brief introduction to some lower-level problems & solutions in "computing systems" (more on this phrase and why it is
				used later)</p>
			  
			  <p>I assume a reasonable background in programming and general computer knowledge.</p>
			  
			  <p>You might find this page especially useful if you are (like me) a freshman Turing Scholar on winter break at the University of Texas at Austin, 
				who has completed CS 314H (Algorithms & Data Structures) and will take CS 429H (Computer Organization & Architecture) in the spring.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="why">
			  <h4>why did you write this?</h4>
			  <p>This is really a two-part question: 'Why were you motivated to write this?' and 'What qualifies you to write this?'.  The first one is easy:
				Break is really boring.  The second one is more difficult.  The most correct answer is probably 'nothing', but I think there are two reasons
				why you might want to read this as opposed to just breaking out the textbook.</p>
			  <ul>
				<li><strong>Specialization</strong> - I am writing with a very specific audience in mind, so I can reference and make assumptions about what you know.</li>
				<li><strong>Format</strong> - I am trying to be much more casual than a textbook, and much more brief.  In many places, I will probably trade absolute
				  completeness for brevity, though I will try not to sacrifice correctness.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p>To sum up, the answer to the question "Why would I read this instead of a textbook?" is "Because this document has different design goals that I believe 
				make it more accessible and quicker to comprehend".</p>

			  <h4>what is meant by "Computing Systems"?</h4>
			  <p>
				A course on "Systems" is generally considered part of the core of an education in Computer Science, which is most generally defined as the study of
				computation.  In order to give that definition substance, we also have to define computation, which is rather difficult.  We humans have been computing
				since we became a species; our ancestors computed the optimum trajectory of their spears so that they could bring down a mammoth and eat, the best path
				to run to avoid being eaten by a tiger, and so on.  At some point, we invented numbers and other notation to make computation easier.  Now you could
				precisely compute the exact number of sheep you needed to shear to have enough wool to sell to buy food over the winter.  Since
				then, we've advanced slightly as a species, and our computing needs advanced with us.  Now we use machines to compute all sorts of things: the lowest 
				grade you can get on your final and still pass, the cheapest way to fly from Austin to New York, how to win a game of chess, and just about everything
				else.  Thus, the best definition I can think of for computation is 'transforming data in some meaningful way'.  You might also define a computation as:
				'a process which depends on some amount of information as input, and produces some amount of information as output'.  Of course, these definitions
				(just like our first) reference other terms; we will discuss technical definitions of the terms referenced in later sections (probably).
			  </p>
			  <p>The generality of my chosen definition of computation is intentional - but if we've been computing since the dawn of our species, why is the field of 
				computer science so young?  Digital computers and other fancy machines certainly make certain kinds of computation easier, but you certainly can study
				computation without them.  So why did computer science only really get established as a discipline until the invention of the computer?  To be honest,
				I don't have an answer.  The best I can come up with is that before we had machines to compute for us, the only way to compute something was to learn
				the necessary math (for computing is deeply entwined with mathematics) and work it out yourself.  The bottleneck of this process was comprehending the
				math - As long as you understood, mathematically, what you needed to compute, the computation itself was generally little more than an afterthought by
				comparison.  Only when we had to explain the process of computation to a machine, unable to 'understand' the math as we do, did we really think to 
				separate <i>what</i> was being computed with <i>how</i> it was computed.  And by that circuitous route we arrive at my definition of computer science:
				"the study of <i>how</i>"
			  <p>In accordance with its origins, the field of computer science is most often studied with digital computers - a computer program is essentially a 
				distillation of mathematical understanding into a form that can be fed to a "computing system".  This implies my definition of "Computing System":
				something that executes a program.  The computing systems that we are most interested in are 'stored-program digital computers' - this term reflects
				the fact that not all computers necessarily "store" their programs in a way that can be easily changed (it might be baked into the hardware), and that
				not all computers have to be digital (operating by electrical impulses that considered to be in a discrete set of states (commonly 1 and 0) - a compute
				might also be electromechanical (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)">the Z-3</a>) or just mechanical (like Babbage's
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_engine">Analytical Engine</a>)).  The study of 'Systems', then, for our purposes, is the study of the
				properties, design, and implementation of stored-program digital computers.

			  <h4>why is this interesting?</h4>
			  <p>A "Systems" class is a core part of pretty much every computer science degree because it gives you grounding in what is actually happening when you
				program.  <p>
