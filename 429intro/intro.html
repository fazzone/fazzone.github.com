			<h4>what is this document?</h4>
			<p>This is intended to be a brief introduction to some lower-level problems & solutions in "computing systems" (more on this phrase and why it is
			  used later)</p>
			
			<p>I assume a reasonable background in programming and general computer knowledge.</p>
			
			<p>You might find this page especially useful if you are (like me) a freshman Turing Scholar on winter break at the University of Texas at Austin, 
			  who has completed CS 314H (Algorithms & Data Structures) and will take CS 429H (Computer Organization & Architecture) in the spring.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div id="why">
			<h4>why did you write this?</h4>
			<p>This is really a two-part question: 'Why were you motivated to write this?' and 'What qualifies you to write this?'.  The first one is easy:
			  Break is really boring.  The second one is more difficult.  The most correct answer is probably 'nothing', but I think there are two reasons
			  why you might want to read this as opposed to just breaking out the textbook.</p>
			  <ul>
				<li><strong>Specialization</strong> - I am writing with a very specific audience in mind, so I can reference and make assumptions about what you know.</li>
				<li><strong>Format</strong> - I am trying to be much more casual than a textbook, and much more brief.  In many places, I will probably trade absolute
				  completeness for brevity, though I will try not to sacrifice correctness.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p>To sum up, the answer to the question "Why would I read this instead of a textbook?" is "Because this document has different design goals that I believe 
				make it more accessible and quicker to comprehend".</p>
